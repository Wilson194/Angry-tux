Running the game
=================

If you have all ready installed game, you can play! Just type in console in activated venv:

``AngryTux``

Here you go, you can play!


There is also some games modes that you can chose.


Movement modes
---------------

You can chose from two movements modes: **basic** and **realistic**. In basic mode, missiles just lowering some angle and enemies
just stand at one place and doing nothing. Boooooriiiiing!

But if you chose **realistic** mode, missiles have ballistic curve and enemies are moving. Much more fun, trust me!

You can chose mode with console parameter: ``AngryTux -f mode``


Levels
------------

There is also two levels by default and you can create some new levels. You can specify, which level you want to play with console
parameter: ``AngryTux -l number``. There are only 2 level now, but you can help game to improve.
